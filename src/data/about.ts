I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Electronics, specializing in Intelligent Sensors and Instrumentation at Hochschule Bremen, following my completion of a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am fluent in English and can converse comfortably in German.

Professionally, I previously worked as an Assistant Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., where I was part of the development team for The Home Depot in the retail domain. My responsibilities included web application development, migration, and deployment, with a strong focus on writing well-tested, maintainable code, producing clear documentation, and working closely with clients in Agile/Scrum environments. I am proficient in C++, Java, Python, and Dart.

I actively develop my skills through personal projects, such as a [Plant Care App](https://ryanromeodev.github.io/Plant-App/) built with Flutter/Dart. It features timeline-based fertilizing reminders, local JSON-based storage, dark/light theme options, multilingual support, and notification scheduling. I also use Jupyter notebooks and NumPy for data visualization and analysis, particularly for applications in electronics and sensor data.

To further my practical electronics knowledge, I designed and soldered a [Biquad Filter](https://ryanromeodev.github.io/hsb-amcd-sose2025-5/) to isolate specific frequenciesâ€”a project that refreshed my hands-on skills with KiCAD for schematic/PCB design and SMD soldering techniques.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy gaming (Minecraft and Skyrim) and reading literature, from classics like *1984* and *Crime and Punishment* to modern novels like *Kafka on the Shore*.
