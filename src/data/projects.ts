    desc: `This project centers on the analog circuit design of a universal biquad filter (Low Pass, High Pass, Band Stop and Band Pass Filters) targeting a corner frequency of 1 kHz and a quality factor (Q) of 10. The design process spans the complete development cycleâ€”from initial specification and simulation to physical layout and hardware realization. Key phases include schematic design, functional modeling, simulation, and full PCB development.`,
